## Dataset Description
The M5 dataset, generously made available by Walmart, involves the unit sales of various products sold in the USA, organized in the form of grouped time series. More specifically, the dataset involves the unit sales of 3,049 products, classified in 3 product categories (Hobbies, Foods, and Household) and 7 product departments, in which the above-mentioned categories are disaggregated.  The products are sold across ten stores, located in three States (CA, TX, and WI). In this respect, the bottom-level of the hierarchy, i.e., product-store unit sales can be mapped across either product categories or geographical regions, as follows:
